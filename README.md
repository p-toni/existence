# A Manifest of Ownership and Sovereignty in the AGI Future
One of the critical questions in this future is whether people will maintain ownership and sovereignty over their digital profiles, including the vast amounts of personal data generated through their interactions with AGI systems. Here are some considerations:

## Data Sovereignty

> Individuals should own and control their digital profiles, which include their communication preferences, behavioral data, and interaction history. They should be able to transfer this profile between AGI systems (data portability).

## Profile Churn

> People should have the right to churn their profile and preferences between AGI systems, choosing the AGI that best aligns with their values and priorities. This allows competition and prevents monopolization by a single AGI provider.

## Consent and Control

> Any use of personal data or preferences for curating information should be consent-based. Users should have the power to opt out of specific AGI recommendations or request more transparency in how their profile is being used.

## Security and Privacy

> Privacy measures, such as encryption and blockchain-based verification, will need to ensure that individualsâ€™ profiles are secure from unauthorized access or manipulation. Decentralized networks could allow individuals to retain control over their data.

## Transparency and Fairness

> AGI systems should offer clear explanations for the decisions they make when curating content or acting as communication intermediaries. This transparency will help mitigate potential bias and manipulation.

## Challenges with Multiple AGIs

> Data Fragmentation: If people can move their profiles across AGIs, ensuring consistent experiences across different systems will be crucial. AGIs might need to adopt interoperable standards to prevent fragmentation of user data.

> Monetization and Ethics: AGI companies might try to monetize user profiles by creating detailed psychographic data. Strict regulatory frameworks will be needed to protect against exploitation.
